# GraphQL Integration Todo List

## Objective
Add functionality to read data from a GraphQL endpoint and display the results in a table, following the existing patterns in the application.

## Plan

### Phase 1: Setup GraphQL Client
- [x] 1. Add GraphQL client NuGet package (GraphQL.Client)
- [x] 2. Create GraphQL client configuration in appsettings.json
- [x] 3. Register GraphQL client service in Program.cs

### Phase 2: Create GraphQL Models
- [x] 4. Create model class for GraphQL response data (e.g., User, Post, or similar)
- [x] 5. Create GraphQL query string constant or class

### Phase 3: Create GraphQL Service
- [x] 6. Create a simple GraphQL service class to handle API calls
- [x] 7. Add service registration to dependency injection container

### Phase 4: Controller Integration
- [x] 8. Add new controller action to fetch data from GraphQL endpoint
- [x] 9. Handle potential errors and add basic logging

### Phase 5: View Creation
- [x] 10. Create new Razor view to display GraphQL data in table format
- [x] 11. Add navigation link to main layout for new GraphQL page
- [x] 12. Style table using existing Bootstrap classes

### Phase 6: Testing
- [x] 13. Test the GraphQL integration
- [x] 14. Verify error handling works correctly

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal and follow existing patterns
- Use a simple public GraphQL API for testing (e.g., JSONPlaceholder GraphQL or similar)
- Reuse existing table styling from Products page
- Follow the same MVC pattern as the existing Products functionality

## Review Section

### Summary of Changes
- Successfully integrated GraphQL client functionality into the existing ASP.NET Core MVC application
- Added support for fetching data from a public GraphQL API (Countries API)
- Implemented clean separation of concerns with service layer pattern
- Created responsive table display following existing UI patterns
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### Key Files Modified/Created
**New Files Created:**
- `Models/Country.cs` - Country and Continent models for GraphQL response
- `GraphQL/CountryQueries.cs` - GraphQL query constants
- `Services/CountryService.cs` - Service layer for GraphQL operations
- `Views/Home/Countries.cshtml` - Countries display view with Bootstrap table

**Modified Files:**
- `webapp1.csproj` - Added GraphQL.Client and GraphQL.Client.Serializer.SystemTextJson packages
- `appsettings.json` - Added GraphQL endpoint configuration
- `Program.cs` - Registered GraphQL client and services in DI container
- `Controllers/HomeController.cs` - Added Countries action with error handling
- `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` - Added Countries navigation link

### Technical Implementation Details
- **GraphQL Client**: Used GraphQL.Client with SystemTextJson serializer
- **API Endpoint**: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql (public countries API)
- **Service Pattern**: Implemented ICountryService interface with dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and logging at service and controller levels
- **UI Consistency**: Reused existing Bootstrap table styling and navigation patterns

### Additional Notes
- All changes followed existing application patterns and conventions
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Error handling gracefully falls back to empty list display
- Application builds and runs successfully
- GraphQL integration is ready for use and can be accessed via the Countries navigation link
